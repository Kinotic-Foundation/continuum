This allows developers to easily integrate and reuse existing code modules, reducing development time and increasing code reusability.</p><h2 id="microservices-and-iot-support" tabindex="-1">Microservices and IoT Support <a class="header-anchor" href="#microservices-and-iot-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>One of the key benefits of the Continuum Framework is its ability to enable the development of microservices-based architectures. This allows developers to break down applications into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. The Continuum Framework&#39;s support for microservices architecture provides developers with greater flexibility, agility, and scalability, enabling them to build more resilient and adaptable applications.</p><p>The Continuum Framework also supports the Internet of Things (IoT) by providing developers with the necessary tools to connect and manage a wide range of IoT devices. This includes support for device discovery, data management, and communication protocols, making it easier for developers to integrate IoT devices into their software applications. Additionally, the framework&#39;s support for cloud-native development allows developers to take advantage of cloud-based services to enhance the functionality and scalability of their IoT applications.</p><h2 id="ongoing-research-and-innovation" tabindex="-1">Ongoing Research and Innovation <a class="header-anchor" href="#ongoing-research-and-innovation" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>To ensure that the Continuum Framework remains at the forefront of software development, the Kinotic Foundation is committed to ongoing research and innovation. This includes incorporating the latest technologies and best practices into the framework, as well as collaborating with developers to gather feedback and continuously improve the framework&#39;s features and functionality.</p><h2 id="accessibility-and-inclusion" tabindex="-1">Accessibility and Inclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#accessibility-and-inclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>As a nonprofit organization, the Kinotic Foundation is dedicated to making the Continuum Framework accessible to all developers, regardless of their background or financial resources, in the hopes of fostering a collaborative and inclusive community of software developers.</p><p>Overall, the Continuum Framework empowers developers with the tools and knowledge they need to create innovative and impactful software solutions. Its support for microservices and IoT, coupled with ongoing research and innovation, makes it a comprehensive and adaptable solution for developers seeking to build high-quality software applications.</p><h2 id="contributing" tabindex="-1">Contributing <a class="header-anchor" href="#contributing" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>We welcome contributions to Structures from the community.
