# Continuum Services
Continuum applications are built on Continuum services, which are created using [Spring](https://spring.io/) and deployed as [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) applications. 
Unlike standard Spring services, Continuum services are automatically discoverable and can transparently communicate with each other.
In this page, we will explore how Continuum services are discovered and interconnected for seamless communication.
